# mchv230vac1.5kw-33ck256mp508-pmsm-an1299-foc-pll v1.0.0
### Release Highlights
This is the first version of code for sensorless field oriented control of PMSM using PLL estimator and single-shunt current reconstruction algorithm on MCHV-230VAC-1.5KW Development Board(EV78U65A) with dsPIC33CK256MP508 MC DIM(EV62P66A). 
The code is set up for running Leadshine 400W 220VAC Servo Motor(EL5-M0400-1-24 : AC300025).
This motor was tested under no load conditions. To achieve optimal performance under loaded conditions, the control parameters in the firmware may need additional tuning.
